# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model using the Salary Prediction dataset. The goal is to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience.

## Project Tasks

1. **Import and Preprocess the Dataset**  
   - Loaded the dataset from an online source  
   - Checked for null values and basic statistics  
   - isualized the data distribution using a scatter plot  

2. **Split Data into Train-Test Sets**  
   - Divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing data  
3. **Fit a Linear Regression Model**  
   - Used `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` to train the model  
   - Predicted salaries using the test set  
4. **Evaluate the Model**  
   - Evaluated performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²)  
5. **Plot the Regression Line**  
   - Visualized the regression line over the test data  
   - Displayed the learned model equation and interpreted coefficients  
## Tools Used
- Python (jupyter notebook) 
- pandas  
- matplotlib    
- scikit-learn  
## Conclusion
The model shows a strong linear relationship between years of experience and salary, making it a good fit for simple linear regression. This project is a fundamental example of applying machine learning to a real-world regression problem.
